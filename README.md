-	Label the data: on data_labeling.py choose the path of the data, and determine whether it’s fake or real data. Then run the script. 
-	Prepare the data: run split_data.py.
-	Train the YOLO model: run train.py.
-	Predict: define the trained model’s path in main.py and run the script. (There’s an option to save the prediction by typing in the terminal)
